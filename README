HyprTV is a Twitter bot that sends remiders about TV shows,
so you'll never forget about when is the latest episode!

I'm planning about adding more features in the future, but for the moment I'm focusing on this aspect.

HyprTV is currently planning to be running on Google App Engine, so it's written to use the unique database GAE offers.

I'll be looking for help in maintaining the database for the TV shows, as I can't sit all day updating all the tv shows.
